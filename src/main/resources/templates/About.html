<title>About Blake Skates</title>

<h1> The Origin of Blake Skates</h1>
<h2>It all started when I broke my last board doing a totally intentional trick (definitely not a fall). As I lay there, staring at the sky and questioning my life choices, I thought,
    “What if I just sold skateboards instead of breaking them?”

    Blake Skates was born.

    Fueled by caffeine, questionable decision-making, and a love for all things on wheels, this shop exists to keep you rolling — whether you’re landing tricks or just trying not to faceplant in front of a crowd.

    Welcome to the skate life. It’s all downhill from here (literally — we love a good hill bomb). 🤙
